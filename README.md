# -Naive-Bayes-Classifier-from-Scratch
 The goal of this task is to implement the Naive Bayes classifier from scratch in Python. This exercise will help you understand the fundamental principles of this probabilistic algorithm without relying on external libraries for the core logic. You will use the classifier to predict whether a person will play tennis based on weather conditions
